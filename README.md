# Data science portfolio by Madhav Thaker

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I have built for various personal projects and experiments. I've split up all of the projects based on solution categories.

Professional projects and accomplishments can be found on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/madhavthaker/).


## Natural Langauge Processing 

### Supervised Learning

**Automatic Essay Grading Tool**

Developed an Automatic Essay Grading tool in Python that utilizes TensorFlow to build a Four-Layer feed-forward neural network. Additionally, by utilizing the Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK) package, I built a regression model that incorporates features such as grammar and sentiment to grade test essay sets. A Spearman's Correlation of approximately 0.90 was achieved. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/madhavthaker/AES)

### Unsupervised Learning 

**Comparing Various Extractive Text Summarization Techniques**

[TBD]

**Presidential Inauguration Sentiment Comparison**

Utilized NTLK and TextBlob packages to analyze the sentence by sentence sentiment of Obama and Trump's Inauguration Speeches. Using GGPlot, this sentiment was visualized to help analyze the Presidentsâ€™ emotion as each speech progressed. This analysis was done in Python. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/madhavthaker/InuagurationComparison/blob/master/Inauguration%20Analysis.ipynb). Here is the final output visualization:

## Computer Vision

### Supervised Learning 

**Emotion Detection**

Developed a Convolutional Neural Network to analyze the emotion (7 emotional states) in a specific greyscale static image. Utilized Tensorflow to construct the Neural Network and visualized its performance and architecture using Tensorboard. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/madhavthaker/EmotionDetection/blob/master/projectscript.py)

### Unsupervised Learning

## Structured Data

### Supervised Learning



**How well would Messi do in a different league?**

Developed a negative binomial model to predict the number of goal Lionel Messi would score in a different league. Only leveraged defense as a predictor and plan to incorporate weather and historical record against a specific team. Coded in R and can be found [here](https://github.com/madhavthaker/MessiPredictions/blob/master/Goals%20in%20Other%20Leageus.R). 

### Unsupervised Learning & EDA

**Exploring NYC Taxi Trip Data**

Developed a EDA kernel for the "New York City Taxi Trip Duration" kaggle competition. Kernel can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/madhavt/yet-another-data-visualization-notebook)
